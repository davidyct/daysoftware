Experimental Modal Analysis (EMA) can be accomplished in both the time domain and the frequency domain. For a pavement structure in static equilibrium (no rigid body modes) with a single force dynamic input, the vibrations are centered around the static equilibrium position. From the time histories of an input force and displacement response (Falling Weight), the frequency response function (FRF) can be calculated. The FRF could also be directed determined by using a stepped-sine Frequency Sweep at a constant force. 

In both cases, fitting the experimental FRF to the theoretical FRF returns the poles and residues. The fitted FRF is a function of forcing frequency, poles and residues. Setting the forcing frequency to zero, (which is not possible to do experimentally), the fitted FRF response is the sum of the ratio of residues to poles, which is the equivalent static response. 

At zero frequency, the equations of motion with constant stiffness and different values of mass and damping, reduce to a function of the constant stiffness only. This is an important consideration when performing an EMA. The zero-frequency response is independent of the system mass, any addition/subtraction of weight on the structure due to test/operating conditions does not affect the end result of the zero-frequency response. 

The zero-frequency response is a response measurement and not the modulus of elasticity (E value) and has been shown to be equivalent to the linear portion of the static plate load test. To get the E value and pavement layer stresses, one needs the geometry and a mechanistic model of the structure, typically the theoretical multiple layer pavement response model. 

The subgrade E value has the most significance in the pavement response and if the stress-load repetitions/deformation-load repetitions curves are available for the pavement type, the life expended can be calculated and if a forecast is available, the remaining life can be calculated.
