<b>Purpose</b>
<br/>
A resource for educators and researchers interested in the characterization of mechanical material properties from static and dynamic analysis, specifically the modulus of elasticity, E.
<br/><br/>
The stress-strain relationship contains the material property information that must be evaluated by experiments (laboratory or field), which requires the use of both theoretical and experimental mechanics.
<br/><br/>
<b>Elastic and Plastic Equilibrium</b>
<br/>
When to use the theory of elasticity and when to use the theory of plasticity depends on the magnitude of the stresses and/or strains and the deviation of the stress-strain relationship from Hooke's law.
<br/><br/>
If the stresses and/or strains are large and/or the deviation of the stress-strain relationship from Hooke's law is large then the theory of plasticity should be used.
<br/><br/>
Both destructive and non-destructive identification (NDI) methods will be explored.
<br/><br/>
Destructive methods will be used to determine the initial elastic property, the ultimate strength and the fatigue strength.
<br/><br/>
NDI methods will depend on linear, time independent (LTI) models of materials including visco-elastic models (Kelvin-Voight).
<br/><br/>
With NDI, experimental stresses and/or strains must be kept within the elastic limit.
How to determine when the experimental stresses and/or strains are outside the elastic limit and/or are non-linear will be explored.
